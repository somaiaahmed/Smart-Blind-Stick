# Smart-Blind-Stick

A blind person finds it difficult to detect the presence of any obstacles in their way while moving
from one place to another and it is very difficult to find the exact location of the stick if it has
been misplaced. Thus, the smart stick comes as a proposed solution to help the visually impaired
people in their day-to-day living without the help of others. In this paper, we proposed a solution
for blind people by using an ultrasonic sensor in the blind stick. The instrument stands are used
to perceive the obstacles at the range of four meters and the infrared instrument is castoff to
perceive the nearer complications in front of the blind people. Thus, the radio frequency
transmitter and receiver help the user to find the exact location of the smart stick with the help of
a buzzer. The vibration motor which is placed in the smart stick gets activated and produces a
vibration when any obstacle is detected. This proposed method uses the Arduino UNO as a
controller. The branch is accomplished of sensing all difficulties in front of the user. The smart
stick is user-friendly, has quick response, very low power consumption, is lighter weight and it is
easy to hold and fold by the user.

## Future Work

The implementation of a smart stick that assists a visually impaired person to his
destination safe and secure as it gives a sense of artificial vision. We use an ultrasonic sensor to detect
the obstacles ahead and alarm the blind person about the obstacles through a beep sound that is
produced by DC Buzzer. In the future, we intend to add some modifications to improve the performance
of the system. These include a global positioning method to find the position of the user using the GPS,
and GSM modules to communicate the location to relatives or caregivers. In addition, we can use
various sensors such as infrared sensors and water sensors.
